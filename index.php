                <p>Growing up, kids always have movies that stick with them until they grey. Me, I wasn't too interested in movies. I saw the blockbusters when they came to the local theatre, but it's hard to get the excitement or the imersive feeling of being in another world from films like <em>Scary Movie II</em>. It just doesn't happen, and it wasn't until I turned 16 that I saw a film called <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em>, and it was one of the first movies I saw and felt really good in just watching it.
                <p>I always remember the film in retrospect as being vibrant and brimming with lively music; nothing but visual chaos that easily translates into a certain overwhelming ecstasy for the viewer. But, uh, I watched it again recently, and it's pretty dull in terms of saturation. Scenes are generally long, giving it a drawn-out feel at first, but really it's just a more realistic pace. Life doesn't happen as quickly as it seems to in a Hollywood film. So neither of those memories of the movie are technically true, but I think what the movie lacks in terms of overwhelming visual stimuli, it maintains a similar feeling as a result of its style.
